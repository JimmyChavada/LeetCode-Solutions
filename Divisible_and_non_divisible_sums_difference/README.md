<h2>Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference</h2>
<br>
This repository contains C++ and Java code that calculates the difference between the sum of numbers divisible by a given divisor and the sum of numbers that are not divisible by the same divisor. The code takes an input list of integers, a divisor, and computes the difference between the sums of divisible and non-divisible numbers. This operation can be useful in various data analysis and arithmetic tasks, especially when dealing with datasets containing numeric values.<br>

## Introduction

Calculating the difference between the sums of divisible and non-divisible numbers by a given divisor is a common operation in data analysis and programming. This code provides a straightforward solution to this problem. Whether you are performing data preprocessing, analyzing datasets, or implementing mathematical operations, this code can help you compute the desired difference efficiently.<br>


## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program is straightforward:<br>

1. Take two variables to calculate the sum of numbers which are divisible and non divisible and initialize them with zero.<br>
2. Traverse the whole array and check if its divisible then update the valriable containing the variable containing divisible numbers sum, otherwise update the variable containing the variable containing non divisible numbers sum.<br>
3. Return the difference of the value of divisible numbers sum by non divisible numbers.<br>
